        "The party is sent on a mission to blow up an island and create a diversion for the Freelanders. They must face off against the Bot Line, a force of silicon robots with self-repairing capabilities and a shared hive-mind system. The mysterious island is emitting a loud droning sound and has guard towers that are 20' off the ground. The party must set up four bombs on the four corners of the island and detonate them, while avoiding the EMP blasts of the bots. They must also be aware of the phoenixes and the modular plates on the building. Dorinda snipes from the sky and Hayete casts Shatter to take out the bots. In the end, the bots converge and are sucked up by the pink wavy lines under the island.",
